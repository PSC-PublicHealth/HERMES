To setup and run hermes:

First make sure you have pip and virtualenv installed.
On debian/ubuntu based systems:

sudo apt install python-pip
sudo apt install virtualenv

Hermes runs out of the directory that you untar it into but will need to
be initialized first.  Run

./setup_hermes

which should perform all of the initializations.

To run hermes cd to this directory and then

./run_hermes

This should start up a local hermes webserver and then open a tab in your preferred browser to http://localhost:8080/bottle_hermes/top

Hit ctrl-C in the terminal to stop the server when you're done.
