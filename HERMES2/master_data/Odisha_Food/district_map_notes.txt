Cuttack_district_map.png and Khorda_district_map.png are from
http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/orissa/tehsil/khordha.html
etc. downloaded Aug. 1 2016.

The geojson from gadm.org for Odisha has the following sub-geometries:
For Khordha: Bhubaneshwar, Khordha
For Cuttack: Athagarh, Banki, Cuttack

Note that the map outlines for the geojson don't match the
district_map.png files- some region has been mis-assigned in the north
of Bhudaneshwar District.
