The original source for this document was "Vaccine Presentations Niger
EPI 2008.xls".

Storage type information was added from "Vaccine storage.xlsx"

Storage lifetime information was added from "Vaccine Presentations
Niger EPI 2008 6.10.09.xls".  Where an interval was given, I've used
the middle of the interval.  That value goes in the column for the
best storage category for that vaccine. For freeze dried vaccines, I
have put a value in the "freezer" column which is only slightly less,
since storage in the freezer is not advised but seems to be
non-harmful.  For oral polio, since it seems to survive for a while at
the clinic level where it is stored in the cooler, I assumed it has
2 months' lifetime in that environment.  Entries for which the
times are negative are those for which I don't have good values, but I
know which storage medium is best.  (Best is greatest absolute value).

I got initial information on Meningococcal Rotavirus (freeze-dried
and liquid) and Pneumococcal from "Vaccine_Volume_Calculator_2009.xls".

Tina supplied some restrictions on what can and cannot be frozen in an
email conversation on 20100107.
