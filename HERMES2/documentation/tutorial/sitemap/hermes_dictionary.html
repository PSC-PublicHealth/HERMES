<h2 id="supplychainbasics">Supply Chain Basics</h2>

<blockquote>
<p id="supplychain"><strong>Supply Chain</strong><br />The term for a system of processes through which product is moved from a manufacturer to the user.</p>

<p id="push"><strong>Push [system]</strong><br />Alternately called an <i>allocation system</i>. In this type of system, the person who issues the supplies (e.g. the vendor, the higher level) calculates the quantities sent through to the next level. Quantities can either be fixed in size or variable with regards to the demand (referred to in HERMES as "<i>varpush</i>").</p>

<p id="pull"><strong>Pull [system]</strong><br />Alternately called a <i>requisition system</i>. In this type of system, the location which recieves the supplies (at the lower level) calculates the quantities that are required at their level. Quantities are usually variable, as these systems request whatever stock is needed.</p>

<p id="coldchain"><strong>Cold Chain</strong><br />The supply chain when it utilizes cold devices, such as refrigerators, freezers and vaccine carriers, as well as cold vehicles (e.g. cold trucks). Important in the vaccine supply chain because vaccine efficacy is maintained <i>only</i> when vaccines are kept in the cold chain; otherwise vaccines lose efficacy.</p>

<p id="leafnodes"><strong>Leaf Nodes</strong><br />Alternately called <i>service delivery points</i> or <i>SDPs</i>. According to the <a href="http://deliver.jsi.com/dlvr_content/resources/allpubs/guidelines/LogiHand.pdf" target="_blank">USAID Logistics Handbook</a>, it is defined as "any facility where users receive supplies related to health services." These locations are usually hospitals and health centers, but may also include mobile units, community-based distributors, laboratories, and health posts. For the purposes of our modeling, "leaf nodes" refer to health clinics.</p>

<p id="supplychainlevels"><strong>Supply Chain Levels</strong><br />The administrative depots where products are usually kept and vaccine is transferred to and from. For the purposes of our experiments, we usually use the levels of <i>Central</i>, <i>Region</i>, <i>District</i>, and <i>Clinics</i> (alternately called <i>Integrated Health Clinic</i> and <i>Integrated Health Center</i>, <i>depending on the country</i>)

<p id="shippingloop"><strong>Shipping Loop</strong><br />A type of shipping route in which a vehicle travels to multiple destinations, before returning to its point of origin. (Alternatively, there are <i>point-to-point shipments</i>, in which the vehicle delivers or picks up just enough vaccine for its one delivery location.)</p>

<h2 id="vaccinesupplychainterminology">Vaccine Supply Chain Terminology</h2>

<blockquote>
<p id="EPI"><strong>EPI</strong><br /><b>E</b>xpanded <b>P</b>rogram on <b>I</b>mmunization. A program started by the <a href="http://www.who.int" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> in 1974, with the goal of making vaccines for childhood diseases available to children throughout the world. This is the program that dictates the specific vaccines, ages and doses per child for each specific country</p>

<p id="NVI"><strong>NVI</strong><br /><b>N</b>ew <b>V</b>accine <b>I</b>ntroduction. The catch-all term for the introduction of new vaccines into the standard EPI regimen.</p>

<p id="stockout"><strong>Stockout</strong><br />The term for when a location runs out of a particular product's stock. Can either be a partial stockout (a stockout for a particular product) or a full stockout (when the location has run out of ALL products' stock).</p>

<p id="supplyratio"><strong>Supply Ratio</strong> (<b>Vaccine Availability</b>)<br />Defined as <font size="2" face="courier new">[treated individuals]/[total number of individuals]</font>. Analogous to <i>prevalence</i>, which is a measure in public health. When applied specifically to vaccines, it can be denoted as <i>vaccine availability</i>.</p>

<p id="openvialwaste"><strong>Open Vial Waste</strong><br />Occurs when vials are opened but not all the doses are completely consumed before the vaccine vial expires. This process has been detailed by a previously published VMI file and the WHO's <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2000/WHO_V&B_00.09.pdf" target="_blank">Multi-Dose Vial Policy</a> (<i>MDVP</i>)</p>

<p id="baselinescenario"><strong>Baseline Scenario</strong><br />The supply chain as it currently stands - with no population, storage, transportation or policy modifications.</p>

<p id="4x4truck"><strong>4x4 Truck</strong><br />Refers in this case to a pick-up truck, <i>not</i> an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). The space available for vaccines varies based on the specifications for the country-specific truck, as well as if it is a single-cab or a double-cab truck.</p>

<p id="vaccinecarrier"><strong>Vaccine Carrier</strong><br />A type of cold box carried to the <a href="hermes_dictionary.html#leafnodes">leaf nodes</a> of a supply chain, usually on a motorcycle.</p>

<p id="MDVP"><strong>MDVP</strong><br /><b>M</b>ulti-<b>D</b>ose <b>V</b>accine <b>P</b>olicy. Created by the WHO to document the use of multi-dose vials for multiple immunization sessions. (Essentially, all vaccines, once reconstituted, can be used up to 6 hours after reconstitution.) See <i>open vial waste</i> for more details. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="probabilitydistributions">Probability Distributions</h2>

<blockquote>
<p id="stochasticmodel"><strong>Stochastic Model</strong><br />Alternately called a <i>probabilistic model</i>. The outputs of the model will vary slightly each time, as the model is based on the selection of a random number.<br /><i>Stochasticity</i> refers to a process which uses a random variable and/or uses a random sampling procedure which, over time and many trials, can approximate a certain outcome (opposed to a <i>deterministic</i> process, which parameterizes a variable into a discrete unit, which is subsequently used to create a certain outcome).</p>

<p id="poissondistribution"><strong>Poisson Distribution</strong><br />The distribution from which the number of patients arriving at a clinic per vaccination session, and any other process involving a random number selection, is based. It is a discrete statistical distribution which expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. It is usually based on the <i>Poisson law of small numbers</i>. This distribution is characterized by the parameters: mean = &#955; and standard deviation = <font face="courier new" size="2">sqrt</font>(&#955;).</p>

<h2 id="vmiprojects">Projects for VMI (Past and Current)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p id="PVSD"><strong>PVSD</strong><br /><b>P</b>assive <b>V</b>accine <b>S</b>torage <b>D</b>evice, alternately known as a <em>passive cold device</em>. The PVSD is the product of research from many sources - such as the refrigerator maker Dometic and <a href="hermes_dictionary.html#IVGG">Intellectual Ventures & Global Good</a>. While we currently collaborate with Global Good, we cannot publish anything on the specifications that have been provided by GG. The main aim of the device is to facilitate immunization outreach to out-of-the-way clinics, and to perhaps replace powered refrigerators at clinic locations.</p>

<p id="bluesky"><strong>Blue Sky Scenario</strong><br />A scenario in which all levels but the national level and the <a href="hermes_dictionary.html#leafnodes">leaf nodes</a> are removed from a supply chain, indicating a direct delivery of goods from the highest level to the lowest level. Devised during the <a href="hermes_dictionary.html#BMGF">BMGF</a> meetings as an alternate supply chain structure. </p>

<p id="mobile"><strong>Mobile scenario</strong><br />A scenario in which PVSDs are implemented as "mobile fridges" between levels in the supply chain, most likely between the district and the clinic levels, eliminating the need for both cold transportation and stationary cold devices. Scenarios using this framework were devised during the BMGF meetings in early 2012.</p>

<p id="geocoding"><strong>Geocoding</strong><br />The process behind finding out geographical coordinates of locations. Usually starting out with a search for geographical locations and an evaluation of currently-available data, it subsequently becomes a search for distances that are used in calculating vehicle costs through a <a href="hermes_dictionary.html#costingspreadsheet">costing spreadsheet</a>. A protocol for the geocoding process can be found <a href="../../hermes_geocoding.html">here</a>.</p>

<p id="buydown"><strong>Buy-Down Project</strong><br />A project funded by the World Bank, dedicated to polio eradication in Niger and Pakistan. Uses a funding mechanism which, if specific indicators are met, converts a loan into a grant. Indicators used are related to vaccine timeliness and vaccine stock inventory. VMI attempted an analysis of supply chain indicators, including those used by the Project. (This project is still being worked on.)</p>
