<h1>Final HERMES Remarks</h1>
<p>This tutorial aimed to cover both the running of a baseline simulation, and various experimental procedures that can be done to "tweak" the model scenario.</p>
<p>The example country that has been used so far has been the Niger model, due to the relative completeness of the data. It is, however, an idiosyncratic model - there are a few things (e.g. "open vial waste") that doesn't have to be dealt with in the other country models.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you have any questions about the particular quirks of the model, please let one of us know!</p>
<h4>Remember: while HERMES appears pretty complex, by <u>practicing</u> different scenarios, you can become proficient at HERMES!</h4>
<br />
<h2>Final HERMES Country Model Notes</h2>
<p>The countries that we currently have models for are listed below. A sketch of each model's idiosyncrasies are after the dash:</p>
<p><u>Current Country Models</u>:
<blockquote><ul>
<li><b>Niger</b> - the first model constructed, it has an idiosyncratic ordering policy & a need for an open vial waste file (which isn't needed in the other models)</li>
<li><b>Thailand</b> - the second model constructed, its ordering policy has shifted from a pre-VMI (vendor-managed inventory) system to a VMI system</li>
<i>Note: from here, all the HERMES models are using the <font face="courier new" size="2">model_generic.py</font> file instead of a country-specific Python file.</i><br />
<li><b>Vietnam</b> - the third model constructed, it uses "catch-all bins" and "surrogates" to model the whole country's supply chains based on the explicit data of a few locations throughout the country</li>
<li><b>Senegal</b> - the fourth model constructed, it again uses "catch-all bins" and "surrogates"</li>
<li><b>Chad</b> - the fifth model constructed, there are two versions of this model: one using the "current" Chad supply chain model, and one that uses a "Revitalized" Chad model (which seeks to optimize the supply chain)</li>
<li><b>Kenya</b> - this model is, by far, the largest model constructed, with over 4,000 locations scattered throughout the country</li>
<li><b>Benin</b> - a draft of the model was created throughout the summer of 2012; the model was used throughout September 2012</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: other country models are being discussed and/or are in the works, but no definitive input files have been created yet.</em></p>
<p>If you have a RedMine account, access the "assumptions documents" for each of the country models <a href="https://hermes.psc.edu:3000/projects/hermes/wiki" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Now that you've gotten information on HERMES and how to run it, practice your HERMES knowledge on the next page link.</p>
