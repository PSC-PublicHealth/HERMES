<h1>New Route Types</h1>
<p><em>These notes were written on May 24<sup>th</sup>, 2012.</em></p>

<p>The Routes tables were redesigned as part of the costing model update in late May, 2012. The way that the Routes now works is that the routes are described as distinct entities, instead of simply being parsed by the model as a connection between the distributor and the client.</p>

<p>This change indicates that transportation is now "housed" at a particular location, instead of materializing to ship stock between locations. As such, this now means that we have to distinguish between routes in which the stock is shipped directly from the higher level to the lower level, and routes where a transport vehicle travels from a lower level to pick up stock from a higher level.</p>

<p><em>Note: "push" and "pull" routes refer to the side of the route from where a order is placed. This new system now allows for greater flexibility in two regards, as it takes into account both the location where a transportation vehicle resides, and the the location from which an order is placed.</em></p>
