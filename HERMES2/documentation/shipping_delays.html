<h1>Overview of using shipping delay</h1>

<p>
Shipping delays can occur before or after the vaccines are picked up 
from a warehouse (or both).  They can be added in the input file and 
overridden or created on a per route basis in the routes file.
</p>
<p>
To enable shipping delays in the input file use the following fields:
<dl>
        <dt>pickupdelayfrequency:
                <dd>frequency of shipping delay incurred before 
                transport starts (0.0-1.0)
        <dt>pickupdelaymagnitude:
                <dd>magnitude in days of shipping delays
	<dt>pickupdelaysigma:
		<dd>if this value exists and is non-zero use 
		a normal distribution the shipping delay 
		with this value as the standard deviation
	<dt>pickupdelayreorder:
		<dd>only meaningful on pull shipments.  
		Defaults to FALSE.  If TRUE allows the 
		order to be recalculated after the pickup
		delay completes.

        <dt>deliverydelayfrequency:
                <dd>frequency of shipping delay incurred during 
                transport (0.0-1.0)
        <dt>deliverydelaymagnitude:
                <dd>magnitude in days of shipping delays
	<dt>deliverydelaysigma:
		<dd>if this value exists and is non-zero use 
		a normal distribution the shipping delay 
		with this value as the standard deviation
</dl>
</p>
<p>
To enable or override shipping delays on a per route basis add
any or all of the following fields to the routes file:
<pre>
        PickupDelayFrequency 
        PickupDelayMagnitude
	PickupDelaySigma 
	PickupDelayReorder
        DeliveryDelayFrequency 
        DeliveryDelayMagnitude
	DeliveryDelaySigma 
</pre>
and fill them in with the corresponding values.  These values 
are only read from the supplier's (RouteOrder:0) line of the      
routes file.
</p>
<p>
The how the duration of the delay is calculated is based
on whether *sigma exists for that route.  If it exists
the duration of the delay is a normal distribution with
*magnitude for the average number of days and *sigma for 
the standard deviation.  Otherwise the duration is 
rand() * magnitude days.
</p>
<p>
If the calculated delay is less than 0 it becomes 0.
</p>
<p>
Delays are not implemented if *magnitude is 0 even though
this might be meaningful for a normal distribution (use 
something like 0.01 instead).
</p>
<p>
As stated above *reorder is only meaningful on pickup of 
pull shipments.  If *reorder is set then the order is 
recalculated after the shipping delay occurs.
</p>
<p>
if a delay occurs the following is printed in the debug output:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;routeprocessname&gt;: shipment is delayed by &lt;days&gt; days 
<br>
or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;routeprocessname&gt;: shipment is delayed en route by &lt;days&gt; days
