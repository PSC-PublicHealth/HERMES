Overview of Adding Refrigerators to UnifiedStorageTypeInfo.csv

Refrigerator type information is stored in master_data/unified/UnifiedStorageTypeInfo.csv .
That file needs to have a column called 'Name', and columns for each of the names in
storageTypeNames in storagetypes.py; at the moment those names are 'freezer', 'cooler',
and 'roomtemperature'.  Any other columns will be ignored.  The volumes should be in liters.

The data we have for Niger comes with columns 'Make', 'Model', 'Year', 'Energy', the volume 
information, and 'Name'.  We are currently using the following pattern for the 'Name':

   N_VR50F_1997_S
   
where 'N_' stands for Nigeria, VR50F is the model name (in this case a model from BP SOLAR),
1997 is the year, and S is the 'energy' code.  The energy codes to be used in the name are:

   E = electric
   S = solar
   G = gas (liquid propane)
   P = petrole (kerosene)
   I = ice
   B = blue ice
   GE = combined gas and electric
   KE = combined kerosene and electric
   U = unknown
   
Unknown years should also be abbreviated '_U_', so for example
one current name is N_PSPR_U_U for a PSPR unit with both year and power supply unknown.

ADDITIONAL RULES FOR NAMES:
-Do not include spaces, or the '*' or '+' characters.  '-' and '/' are OK.
-Use of all-uppercase names is encouraged.
-The special name None means no storage.
