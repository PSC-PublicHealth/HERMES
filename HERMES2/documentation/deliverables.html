<left><h1>Explaining Deliverables and Shippables</h1></left>
<p>In recent repository versions (around SVN r1109), we have changed the DemandModel functionality so that there are two separate abstract base classes of deliverables. These classes are:
<ul>
<li><b>Shippables</b>: an object shipped across the supply chain, which may not individually be given to an end-user. Shippables may be used to prepare a Deliverable, and may be used in conjunction with other Deliverables. Their delivery is implied in the supply chain. An example of a Shippable might be diluent needed to reconstitute lyophilized vaccine, or in the case of fast food, the oil needed to fry fast food.</li>
<li><b>Deliverables</b>: this is an object shipped across the supply chain, which must be prepared at delivery time before it is consequently given to a customer. As Joel explained it, "it is a something that a patient gets, and may require other Shippables before the patient can get it." The delivery of a deliverable is returned by their respective demand model. An example of a Deliverable might be the vaccine which is administered to the population, or the french fries given to a fast food restaurant patron.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>There is a preparation process for deliverables which happens instantaneously. More data about these preparation + delivery processes can be found in the developer documentation <a href="../dev_docs/DeliverablesVsShippables.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Auxillary Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>DemandModels return collections of Deliverables only; the need for consumable Shippables are implied. Therefore, DemandModels display Deliverables only.</li>
<li>Fridges are Deliverables because they are Shippables which are not consumed to prepare any other Shippable for delivery.</li>
</ul>
