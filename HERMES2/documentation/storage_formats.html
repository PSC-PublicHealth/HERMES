<h1>Overview of Adding Refrigerators to UnifiedStorageTypeInfo.csv</h1>
<p>
Refrigerator type information is stored in master_data/unified/UnifiedStorageTypeInfo.csv .
That file needs to have a column called 'Name', and columns for each of the names in
storageTypeNames in storagetypes.py; at the moment those names are 'freezer', 'cooler',
and 'roomtemperature'.  Any other columns will be ignored.  The volumes should be in liters.
</p>
<p>
The data we have for Niger comes with columns 'Make', 'Model', 'Year', 'Energy', the volume 
information, and 'Name'.  We are currently using the following pattern for the 'Name':
<pre>
   N_VR50F_1997_S
</pre>   
where 'N_' stands for Nigeria, VR50F is the model name (in this case a model from BP SOLAR),
1997 is the year, and S is the 'energy' code.  The energy codes to be used in the name are:
<pre>
   E = electric
   S = solar
   G = gas (liquid propane)
   P = petrole (kerosene)
   I = ice
   B = blue ice
   GE = combined gas and electric
   KE = combined kerosene and electric
   U = unknown
</pre>
Unknown years should also be abbreviated '_U_', so for example
one current name is N_PSPR_U_U for a PSPR unit with both year and power supply unknown.

<h3>Additional Rules For Names:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not include spaces, or the '*' or '+' characters.  '-' and '/' are OK.
<li>Use of all-uppercase names is encouraged.
<li>The special name None means no storage.  
</ul>
