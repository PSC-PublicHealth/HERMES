Overview of using shipping delays:

Shipping delays can occur before or after the vaccines are picked up 
from a warehouse (or both).  They can be added in the input file and 
overridden or created on a per route basis in the routes file.

To enable shipping delays in the input file use the following fields:
        pickupdelayfrequency:
                frequency of shipping delay incurred before 
                transport starts (0.0-1.0)
        pickupdelaymagnitude:
                magnitude in days of shipping delays
	pickupdelaysigma:
		if this value exists and is non-zero use 
		a normal distribution the shipping delay 
		with this value as the standard deviation
	pickupdelayreorder:
		only meaningful on pull shipments.  
		Defaults to FALSE.  If TRUE allows the 
		order to be recalculated after the pickup
		delay completes.

        deliverydelayfrequency:
                frequency of shipping delay incurred during 
                transport (0.0-1.0)
        deliverydelaymagnitude:
                magnitude in days of shipping delays
	deliverydelaysigma:
		if this value exists and is non-zero use 
		a normal distribution the shipping delay 
		with this value as the standard deviation


To enable or override shipping delays on a per route basis add
any or all of the following fields to the routes file:
        PickupDelayFrequency 
        PickupDelayMagnitude
	PickupDelaySigma 
	PickupDelayReorder
        DeliveryDelayFrequency 
        DeliveryDelayMagnitude
	DeliveryDelaySigma 
and fill them in with the corresponding values.  These values 
are only read from the supplier's (RouteOrder:0) line of the      
routes file.

The how the duration of the delay is calculated is based
on whether *sigma exists for that route.  If it exists
the duration of the delay is a normal distribution with
*magnitude for the average number of days and *sigma for 
the standard deviation.  Otherwise the duration is 
rand() * magnitude days.

If the calculated delay is less than 0 it becomes 0.

Delays are not implemented if *magnitude is 0 even though
this might be meaningful for a normal distribution (use 
something like 0.01 instead).

As stated above *reorder is only meaningful on pickup of 
pull shipments.  If *reorder is set then the order is 
recalculated after the shipping delay occurs.

if a delay occurs the following is printed in the debug output:
        <routeprocessname>: shipment is delayed by <days> days 
or
        <routeprocessname>: shipment is delayed en route by <days> days
