installing python once installer has been executed:
In a DOS window (alt, "command prompt", or the black-and-white box accessed by typing in "cmd" under "run" in windows xp),
type in the command "cd" until you're in the python directory
i.e., If you're on your desktop and trying to get back to c:\python27, first type in "cd ../../" and press the enter key
until the directory you're in is "C:/" (every "cd ../" gets you one file name backwards in the directory tree)
and then type in "cd python27" and press the enter key -- this should get you in to the python folder
Type in "python.exe" and press enter.
A Python interpreter should come up, signifying that Python has been installed properly.

download and extract simpy to desktop
 (assuming simpy-2.3)

in "URL of repository" type, replacing the square brackets with your user name:
   "svn+ssh://[your_user_name]@hermes.psc.edu/repo/vmirep/trunk/HERMES2"
(remove "[your_user_name]" from the above if you are sharing the repository)
If you get a "PuTTY Security Alert" click "Yes" to "Store key in cache?"
enter your repository password and click "OK"
      You may need to enter your password multiple times.
This will take a minute or so.  Click "OK" when finished.
