<h1>How model.wastageEstimates Gets Initialized And Updated</h1>

<p>

The Model base class has a method called initializeOVWEstimates()
which attaches a VaccineCollection called wastageEstimates to the
model.  This method is called by the owning HermesSim immediately
after it creates and initializes its Model instance; it cannot be
included in Model.__init__ itself because the initialization algorithm
requires sim.vaccines.activeTypeList() to be valid, and that is
brought about by the instantiation of the DemandModel instances by the
model.  The model can prevent this initialization by assigning a value
to its wastageEstimates attribute.  The values in
model.wastageEstimates range from 0.0 (perfect efficiency) to 1.0 and
can be used or ignored by the model in its calculation of shipment
sizes.  If the userInput provides a filename value for 'initialovw'
and that .csv file has the columns 'Names' and 'OVW', the open vial
waste values from that file will be used.  If not, all values are
initialized to 0.5 .  Note that pull shipments set their thresholds at
time 0.0, so having good initial estimates can be important.
</p>
<p>
If userInput defines a value 'wasteestfreq' which is greater than 0.0,
the values will be updated with that frequency and a latency given by
the input value 'wasteestupdatelatency'.  The process that does those
updates is created by the owning HermesSim in response to
wasteestfreq>0, during the phase in which the network is being built.
