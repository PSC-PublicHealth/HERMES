<h1>Render Unto SimPy What Belongs To SimPy: Notes on Handling SimPy
Resources 20111117</h1>

<p>
HERMES is a discrete event simulation, which means that everything
that happens occurs at a specific moment in time.  More specifically,
there is a set-up period in which the simulation environment
(consisting of warehouses, UseVials and transport processes, etc.)
gets built, then sim.simulate() gets called, and thereafter events are
driven by SimPy processes which 'awaken' when their time slice comes
up.  The set-up period happens 'before time' and we are free to set
things up as we see fit, but anything that happens during a SimPy
process's run() method is dealing with a system state which is partly
maintained by SimPy.  Any time a process wakes up, other processes may
be waiting to be allocated supplies from warehouses, for example, so
no code at the HERMES level should 'instantaneously' add or remove
supplies from warehouses.  If we do that, the pending SimPy allocation
may never be resolved, and the process that was waiting for it will
essentially deadlock.  We can't change the number of trucks in the
truck pool, for example, since that is a SimPy resource and some
process may be waiting for a truck to come free.  (<b>Note:</b>
Since that time Trucks have become a distinct type stored in a SimPy
Store named Garage, so we can easily insert more during a simulation.) 
We also can't change
the number of vaccine vials in any Warehouse's .theBuffer, because
SimPy manages that buffer.
</p>
<p>
We can, however, change the state of vaccines in a Warehouse'
.theBuffer, or change any attribute of the Warehouse that SimPy does
not directly reference, or spawn new processes that will do things to
the SimPy data structures by the normal SimPy mechanisms when <em>their</em>
time slice comes up.
</p>
<p>
There is also a hack which allows us to do manipulations on vaccines
in .theBuffer.  Vaccines are stored in VaccineGroups; those groups are
referenced from .theBuffer and potentially from other lists like the
storage lists of the StorageBlocks of specific refrigerators.
Vaccines are always removed from Warehouses using a SimPy <a
href="http://simpy.sourceforge.net/SimPy_Manual/Manuals/Manual.html#using-the-get-filter-function" target="_blank">
'get filter function' 
</a>
which counts out vials of specific vaccine types.  The HERMES code
never does a 'yield get' for VaccineGroups directly.  This allows the
get filter function to manipulate .theBuffer, as long as the total
number of vaccines of each type is preserved.  The hermes code can
thus break up groups, or mark them as having expired.  It can't delete
the expired groups, however- it must wait for them to be returned in
response to a 'yield get' and then drop them.  The groups are dropped
when the 'get' function filters them; that function executes in the
time slice of the process which issued the 'yield get' rather than in
the time slice of the process which changed the VaccineGroup state and
thus avoids potentially screwing up the SimPy state.
