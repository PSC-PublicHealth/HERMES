  <td>
    Actually unify the unified input files, so that the entries are
    not country dependent.
  </td>
  <td>Michelle?</td>

<tr>
  <td>
    Allow overlays of unified input.  The idea here is that
    there would be a Unified file with actually-unified data and 
    additional files with country- or model-specific data.

  <td>
    Make things correspond to the style guide.

<tr><td>Coerce SVN IDs into a single highest svn rev number that can be printed.</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><td>
    Make an overview programming guide covering any global programming conventions that need 
    to be followed for hermes to run.  This includes but is not limited to:<ul>
      <li>opening data files and creating output files using tools in util</li>
      <li>rules to make --deterministic work</li>
    </ul>
</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><td>optionally copy contents of all inputs to an output file.  In this manner we'd have a 
    set of outputs with all of the inputs that created it (with svn versions of the code ideally)
    that can be used to know exactly what was in a hermes run.</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><td>Make the interface handle the input and output zip files</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><td>Make the interface be able to read a HermesOutput and do basic things with it</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><td>Explore using a backing database for the data sets.  Since this is <em>just</em> a backing 
    datastore, would any of the many nosql implementations make more sense?  Maybe dbm style with 
    transactional support?</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><td>Explore persistent accounts</td><td>???</td></tr>
