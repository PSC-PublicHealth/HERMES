<h1>How Recycling Works 20120210</h1>

<p>


When a Fridge or Ice instance is delivered to a Clinic, the oldest
already-attached instance of the same Fridge or Ice instance of the
same FridgeType or IceType gets its RecycleTag set.  Immediately after
the incoming delivery is complete, a get is done using
recyclingGroupFilter() to select the instances with RecycleTag set.
</p>
<p>
If any instances with RecycleTag set are on board at the end of the
recycling pickup at the last client, ShipperProcess or
OnDemandShipment will make a stop at the supplier warehouse and drop
off all the recycling.  This is done with a put which simply deposits
everything with the recycling tag set.
</p>
<p>
<b class=alert>DESIGN QUESTION:</b> 
We don't have a distance value from the last client
back to the supplier for ShipperProcess deliveries.  At the moment
(r808) the distance from the supplier to the first client is used.
</p>
<p>
After delivery at the supplier, the recycling tags on Fridge instances
are cleared by Warehouse.attachStorage().  Recycling tags on Ice
instances are cleared when the instance is stored at freezing
temperatures.  Thus, it's possible for Ice to skip the recycling trip
if appropriate freezer space becomes available at the Clinic where it
was used.
</p>
<p>
During the client delivery cycle of ShipperProcess, allocateSomeGroups
is used to control the supply of Shippable instances with RecyleTag
set.  allocateSomeGroups(excludeRecycling=True) excludes them, but
without the flag they are included. allocateSomeGroups is called with
excludeRecycling=True in ShipperProcess to determine what to take off
the truck.  This is necessary to avoid dropping off recycling items
from one client warehouse at the next client in the delivery chain.
