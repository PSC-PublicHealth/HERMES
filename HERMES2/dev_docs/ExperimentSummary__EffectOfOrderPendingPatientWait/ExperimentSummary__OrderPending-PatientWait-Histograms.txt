Background:

Vaccine transit times of zero are reported from the HERMES model if either the patientWaitInterval or the orderPendingLifetime are greater than zero.

patientWaitInterval (how long a human will wait at a clinic to receive vaccine if none is avaible upon arrival)
orderPendingLifetime (how long a truck will wait for a shipment to arrive if it is not there when the truck arrives for pickup)

There was some concern that this behavior was the result of a bug.  The following experiment investigates this phenomenon.

Question:

How does varying patientWaitInterval, orderPendingLifetime, factory shipment interval, and factory overstock fraction effect the vaccine transit time histograms.

Method:

Using the MozNonVR model as a test case, both the orderPendingLifetime and the patientWaitInterval were systematically varied from zero to their respective default values in a fully factorial experimental design.

The resulting retention time histograms were plotted in a faceted grid using ggplot2 in R.  

Discussion:

Main findings are:

1.) No zero-time transits are reported if both orderPendingLifetime and patientWaitInterval are zero

2.) Even if both paramters are small (but not zero), transit times of zero will still be observed

3.) Even if both parameters are zero, very small (but non-zero) transit times will be observed.

4.) The orderPendingLifetime has a more pronounced effect on the numer of zero-time (and very short) transit times observed.

Additional, interesting observations:

- Certain combinations of the two parameters seem to result in more or less varied distributions of transit times (see figure1)

- Certain values of orderPendingLifetime have a similar effect (see figure2)

Figures:

        ggplot(data=subset(aggregated.moznvr.csv.subday,ReportingLevel=='all'),aes(days_retention)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.0005) + xlim(0,0.05) + facet_grid(PatientWait ~ OrderPending)

    figure2
        ggplot(data=subset(aggregated.moznvr.csv.subday,ReportingLevel=='all'),aes(days_retention)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.0005) + xlim(0,0.05) + facet_grid(PatientWait ~ OrderPending)

    figure3
        ggplot(data=subset(aggregated.moznvr.csv.subday,ReportingLevel=='all' & OrderPending <= 0.05 & PatientWait <= 0.05),aes(days_retention)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.0005) + xlim(0,0.05) + facet_grid(OrderPending ~ PatientWait)
