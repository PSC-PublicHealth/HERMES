<h1>Notes On Module Import Order</h1>

<p>
As of the current rev for date 20111101, we're including
'--deterministic' on the command line.  This is supposed to control
the use of ordered dictionaries; warehouse.py chooses between ordered
and unordered dictionaries when that module is loaded.  The
'deterministic' flag is set in globals.py, which means that
globals.deterministic must have its appropriate value before
warehouse.py is imported.  Since importing any module forces all the
modules it imports to be imported, no module imported before
globals.deterministic is set can import warehouse.py.  But globals.py
itself must be imported, and other modules are needed to parse the
input.  That means that there has to be a group of modules that can be
imported before global flags are set, and a disjoint set that must be
imported later.
</p>
<p>
As of 20111101, the first group includes globals.py, input.py,
kvp_tools.py, util.py, and csv_tools.py.  Everything else is in the
second group, and they have very interconnected import patterns.
(util.filteredWriteCSV does a delayed input of storagetypes.py, but
not until the rest of the environment is fully established).
