<h1>Variations In StorageHistoryVialDays Ietween 'Identical' Runs 20111207</h1>

<p>

Runs which should be identical via identical random seed values and
the use of the --deterministic flag still show small differences in
the StorageHistoryVialDays for the various vaccines.  This is believed
to happen because vial age accounting happens when the associated
VaccineGroups have their getAge() methods called, and some
VaccineGroups are escaping this at the time boundaries of runs under
some circumstances.  I believe this happens because
HermesSim.syncStatistics() does not find and touch VaccineGroups that
are actually in transit at the times it is called.
