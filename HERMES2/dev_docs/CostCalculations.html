<h1>How Cost Calculations Work</h1>

<p>
These comments are as of 20120509.
<p>
The general mechanism is that costs are associated with some class instances (e.g. Warehouses, Routes,
Trucks or Fridges), and each of them is associated with a NoteHolder.  Sometimes the association with
the NoteHolder gets tricky, as when a PVSD moves between levels of the distribution chain.  One or more
ReportingHierarchyNode trees can access each NoteHolder via its StatProvider interface, and those
trees are used to produce the costing reports.  The costing calculations are managed by a CostManager
instance, which owns a PriceTable instance.  The latter is defined by a .csv file provided by the user,
and specifies all the specific pricing info.  The price table info is converted to a base currency on
the fly during loading, using a CurrencyConverter instance which is passed as a parameter to the
constructor for the PriceTable.  Note that the CurrencyConverter does not survive; it is created, used,
and freed at the time of creation of the PriceTabe.  The file, base currency and base year are defined
by the input parameters <em>currencyconversionfile</em>, <em>currencybase</em>, and <em>currencybaseyear</em>.
The conversion table must be based on USD; which is to say that the conversion factors given for USD
muse all be 1.0 .
<p>
Costs come in four categories:
<ul>
<li>Transport costs, including truck milage costs, driver per diem costs, truck per-trip costs (which might
represent rental costs).
<li>Storage costs, including amortization and fuel costs for refrigerators, either on trucks or in warehouses.
<li>Labor costs, including driver salary (but not per diem) and warehouse/clinic worker salary.
<li>Building costs, including rent associated with warehouses.
</ul>

In principle, any cost type can be associated with any Warehouse or ManagedType instance.  In practice, certain items contribute
to certain costs and not to others, so to save computing we don't scan everything for every type of cost.  Transport costs
come only from shipping processes, and are associated with specific trips (so that if no trips are made, transport costs
are zero).  Note that driver per diem is a trasnsport cost, and that different coutries use different algorithms to
calculate per diem days.  Thus there is a special model function, model.Model.calcPerDiemDays, to implement that
calculation.
<p>
Costs are specified by including a "pricetable =" line in the input file for a run.  The fields of a price table
are described in the documentation for the <em>costmodel.PriceTable class</em>; an example is provided for the
TinyTown model.  The names that go into the price table are the names of ManagedType classes, like truck names
or fridge type names, plus the four special names "building", "driver", "healthworker" and "labortotal".  Those 
names are used to label cost information for building costs, driver salary and per diem and healthworker salary.
<p>
Storage costs come from refrigerators and are calculated only at the start and end of the costing interval.  In theory a
refrigerator which is not operating would incur no fuel costs, but we do not check for intervals of non-operation.
<p>
Labor costs can be calculated in two ways: by explicit entry in the pricing table or by event.  By adding a
pricing table entry for 'labortotal' in the 'PerYear' column, one can specify a total labor cost per year for
the given level.  (Conditions are assumed to be 'normal' when looking up this value).  If an applicable
entry for 'labortotal' exists for a given level, it will override and replace the value calculated for that
level by the per-event method described below.
<p>
Alternately, labor costs can
accrue for individual health workers and drivers over time by making 'PerYear' or 'PerTrip'
table entries for 'driver' and 'PerTreatmentDay' costs for 'healthworker'.
Labor costs for health workers are assumed to accrue only on days in which the associated clinic is open- while they
are salaried employees, they are presumably being paid to do something else when the clinic is closed.
Likewise, labor costs for drivers are assumed to apply only during trips, as if they were doing something else at 
other times.  One 'healthworker' 'PerTreatmentDay' worth of costs is added per clinic open day.  One 'driver'
'PerTrip' cost is added for every trip on every route, and the total trip time for the trip contributes to the
cost according to the 'driver' 'PerYear' entry and the fraction of a year of trip duration.  Trip costs as
well as 'PerDiem' costs are associated with the level at which the truck starts the trip, which is not
necessarily the same as the level of the vaccine supplier for the trip.
<p>
Building costs are associated with warehouses and clinics (but not with AttachedClinics) and are proportional to time.  No
other item type contributes to building costs.  These costs represent rent, and upkeep; their use seems kind of ambiguous. 
<p>
The TruckType data in the Routes file specifies the truck type, but it does not create the truck- that is done
when the Garage is created.  As each truck is created for the Garage, its associated fridges are created by the 
Truck() constructor.  Those fridges are associated with the truck, but that can change in the case of PVSDs.  In
any case, there is no natural association between the truck or its fridges and any Warehouse or Route.  This will 
be partially solved when Trucks are associated with home Warehouses, but there will still be some 'homeless' trucks.
We need to specify a policy for which StatProvider ends up with stats for those trucks.
<p>
To Do:
<ol>
<li><b>done</b> Add over-time costs for fridges which are created on trucks.
<li>A user doc describing PriceTable info is needed
<li><b>done</b> Add support for 'conditions' in Routes files.  This may involve a 'truck machine' generator.
<li><b>done</b> Are we going to do something with the Currency column? We now have a currency table, so we should translate 
to *something* on the fly.  Should that be USD?  USD is good, but this is probably a relatively low priority task.
<li>Should unspecified 'Conditions' in the cost table count as 'any'?  Should there be an 'any' for conditions?
<li>Should I do a cost calculation at time zero, just to avoid maddening errors after a long simulation?
<li><b>done</b> Add upside-down routes, so that transport can be attributed properly in models where the clinics own the trucks.
<li><b>dropped</b> Add a check that all currencies in a given table are the same.
<li><b>done</b> Add something to check the PriceTable for entries that can never get used.
<li><b>done</b> Adding costs to ShipperProcess requires adding conditions to elaboratedChain, and modifying elaboratedChain
so that it includes conditions for the return leg of the trip.  Since conditions for a leg get specified at the
*top* of the leg, we should presumably specify transit time for the leg at the top of the leg as well.  Then 
elaboratedChain needs to get one step longer, with the last entry being the return trip.  But don't forget the
special logic for the last stop before the return trip.
<li>Parsing of the 'CONDITIONS' column from the Stores file is handled by model_generic, but not by the other 
models.
<li>model.Model.calculatePerDiemDays needs to get specialized for different models, or at least checked.
<li>We need to track the number of doses delivered to each Warehouse- not doses administered, but delivered.
<li>generateTripCostNotes is working by-trip rather than by-leg, so it gets broken at the end of burn-in and
at the end of a run.
<li><b>done</b> Add a 'labortotal' 'PerYear' entry for each level, and add one instance of that cost per year to the simulation.
<li><b>done</b> Add 'Currency' column to the cost output file.
<li>Add unit test for ReportingHierarchyNode override mechanism
<li>Clean up lon/lat keyword search in model_generic; test for blanks
<li>try/catch clause out of util.longitudeLatitudeSep
</ol>
<p>
Assignments:
<ul>
<li>Joel gets 14 and maybe 6
<li>Jim writes a script to modify Routes files so that we can simplify 10; Jim gets 11
<li>Michelle gets 2
<li>Shawn gets 13, but must wait for Joel.
<li>defer 5 until the users start screaming
of published papers.
<li>12 is implemented by asking Angela and Diana to write down the rules for our 4 countries, and that info
gets handed off to Jim for coding.
</ul>
