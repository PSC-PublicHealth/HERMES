<h1>How Shipping Quantities Are Calculated in the Generic Model</h1>

<p>
These comments are as of 20121108, for SVN rev 1120.
<p>
We have to consider several separate mechanisms.  Pull and varfetch
shipments use one pattern, with different variants between warehouses
and clinics.  Scheduled shipments use a different pattern, and factory
shipments use yet another.  Verifying this basically involves working
through the callback functions in model_generic, which either call
demandmodel methods directly or call recursive warehouse methods which
in turn call demandmodel methods.  These algorithms apply only to vaccines,
of course- things like PVSDs are separated out.
<p>
For clinics receiving pull or varpush shipments, the algorithm for the
shipping quantity is as follows:
<ol>
<li>estimate how many vials it will need, including open vial waste,
using the cumulative distribution function trick.
<li>multiply this number (which may not be an integer) by 1.25.
<li>round up.
<li>Take the minimum of this amount and the amount that fits in the 
clinic storage.
<li>Round down.
<li>Subtract the amount of vaccine already on hand.
<li>If the resulting value is less than zero, use zero.
</ol>
The algorithm for calculating the trigger thresholds for clinics is as
follows.
<ol>
<li>estimate how many vials it will need, including open vial waste,
using the cumulative distribution function trick.
<li>multiply this number (which may not be an integer) by 0.25.
<li>round up.
<li>Take the minimum of this amount and the amount that fits in the 
clinic storage.
<li>Round down.
</ol>
<p>
For warehouses receiving pull or varpush shipments, the algorithm for
the shipping quantity is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Calculate the sum of the expected number of vials used at each of 
the clinics downstream, using the cumulative distribution function trick
separately for each clinic.  Each of these terms is not necessarily an
integer, so the sum isn't necessarily an integer.  Note that if two client
clinics have expected demand of 1.5 vials, this step produces only 3 vials;
the downstream demand is expected to average out over time.
<li>multiply the result by 1.25.
<li>if that value is greater than the amount that fits, use only the
amount that fits.
<li>round down (to avoid having that last vial not fit in available space)
<li>Subtract the amount of vaccine already on hand.
<li>If the resulting value is less than zero, use zero.
</ol>
The algorithm for calculating the trigger thresholds for warehouses is
different, I think mainly for historical reasons.  Remember that the trigger
threshold algorithms need to be executed before the simulation actually starts
to run.
<ol>
<li>Calculate the demand expectation for the total of all downstream clients, in doses.
<li>Scale to vials without rounding.
<li>Divide by (1-wastage), using vaccine-specific wastage values loaded from the 'initialovw'
file.
<li>Round up.
<li>Take the minimum of this amount and the amount that fits in the warehouse storage.
<li>Multiply by 0.25.
<li>Round down.
</ol>
<p>
All scheduled shipments use the following pattern, for both clinics and warehouses.
<ol>
<li>Calculate the sum of the expected number of vials used at each of 
the clinics downstream, using the cumulative distribution function trick
separately for each clinic.  Each of these terms is not necessarily an
integer, so the sum isn't necessarily an integer.  Note that if two client
clinics have expected demand of 1.5 vials, this step produces only 3 vials;
the downstream demand is expected to average out over time.
<li>Multiply by 1.25.
<li>Take the minimum of this amount and the amount that fits in the warehouse storage.
<li>Round down.
<li>Subtract the number of vials already in stock.
<li>If the result is less than zero, use zero.
<li>Round up.
</ol>
<p>
Factory production is calculated by the same algorithm as scheduled shipment size, except that:
<ol>
<li>Instead of multiplying by 1.25, multiply by factoryOverstockScale.
<li>Use the storage space available at the warehouse to which the factory delivers.
</ol>
