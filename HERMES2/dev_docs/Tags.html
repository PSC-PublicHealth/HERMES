<h1>Tags, And Their Meanings And Effects</h1>

<p>

Tags are associated with Shippable instances and are defined in
abstractbaseclasses.Shippable .  They are boolean values manipulated
and tested by the Shippable methods setTag(), clearTag(), getTag(),
and getTagList().  The intention is that the routines which manipulate
Shippables will use specific tags to signal to each other about the
intended fate of the associated Shippable.  This does not preclude the
Shippable manipulating its own tags, but this is not expected to be
the most common case.  An example might be an Ice shippable setting
its DoNotUse tag when its 'melting' timer has gone off.
<p>
In abstractbaseclasses.Shippable, we have:<br>
<table>
<tr><th>Name<th>Value<th align=left>Meaning</tr>

<tr><td><a href="Recycling.html">RecycleTag</a>
<td>"recycle"<td>This tag labels the Shippable to be
picked up and carried upstream by the recycling mechanism.</tr>

<tr><td><a href="DoNotUseTag.html">DoNotUseTag</a>
<td>"donotuse"<td>This tag marks a Shippable as
unuseable.  For example, Shippables marked DoNotUse are not allocated
for outbound shipping, and Fridge instances marked DoNotUse do not
contribute to available storage at their location.</tr>  

<tr><td>InUseTag<td>
"inuse"<td>This tag is intended to be set while a Shippable is 'in
use', so that it will not be doubly used.  For example, an Ice
instance which is associated with a specific IceFridge would have this
tag set by the process that makes the association.</tr>
