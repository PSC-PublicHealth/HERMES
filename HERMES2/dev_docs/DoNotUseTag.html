<h1>How The DoNotUse Tag Works 20120210</h1>
<p>
The general purpose of the DoNotUse tag is to take things out of the 
allocation cycle.  For example, if a portable fridge is not to be used
to store goods at a particular location, the tag should be set on that
fridge.  If an Ice instance is in a melted state, the tag should be set
on that instance.
</p>
<p>
When any Shippable instance has DoNotUseTag set,
allocateOwnerStorageSpace stores it at room temperature, and ignores
any storage space it may contribute.  Similary,
Warehouse.getStorageBlocks() excludes the blocks of any CanStore
instance with DoNotUse set.
</p>
<p>
DoNotUse things are *not* excluded by
warehouse.Warehouse.gotAnyOfThese(), at least at the moment.
</p>
<p>
The DoNotUse tag is set on Ice instances when they are stored at other
than freezer temperature, and cleared when stored at freezer
temperature.
</p>
<p>
allocateSomeGroups(excludeRecycling=False) excludes items with
DoNotUse set.  This is the default, but as of r808 it is never called
this way.
</p>
<p>
warehouse.Warehouse.attachStorage(thing) sets DoNotUse on things
containing the string 'PVSD' if pvsdbugfix=True.  (It also calls
thing.discharge() if callingProc is not None).  
<b class='alert'>THIS NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP.</b>
</p>
<p>
warehouse.Warehouse.detachStorage(thing) clears DoNotUse (and calls
thing.recharge())
</p>
<p>
warehouse.Warehouse.attachIce() clears DoNotUse.  This is necessary so
that allocateStorageSpace will assign it to freezer space.
