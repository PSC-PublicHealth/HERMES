<h1>Comments on the TinyTown Model</h1>

<p>
The TinyTown model (data/tinytest) is meant to test a variety of HERMES 
features in one small model.  Not all of those features are fully implemented,
however, and they don't all fit together well.
<p>
The branches Pittsburgh(1030300)->Wilkinsburg(1030302)->PointBreeze(1030303) 
and Pittsburgh(1030300)->RegentSquare(1030301) are intended as a test
of moving ice, but the part of the code that implements the pairing of ice and
the cold boxes that use it has not yet been implemented.  Thus the cold boxes 
in the clinics get used for the first shipment, but then they are left without
ice, leaving the clinics with zero storage volume.  This essentially turns off
the vaccine deliveries to the clinics; the time course shows vaccine being delivered
on the first shipment but not thereafter.  I have added a (too large) refrigerator
to PointBreeze(1030303) so that it continues to get vaccine after the others fail.
RegentSquare(1030301) is fed by a pull link; the other two are on varpush route D.
<p>
There are currently no straight push routes (as opposed to varpush) in this 
model.  
<p>
This is because it uses model_generic, which uses the ProjectedDemand
mechanism to calculate demand.
<p>
tiny_input_popsicles.kvp is intended to use UnifiedVaccineTypeInfo_popsicles.csv, which is
intended as a stress test for the shippables-vs-deliverables code: massive numbers of popsicles
are pulled through the pipeline to accompany demand for a vaccine.  UnifiedVaccineTypeInfo_popsicles
should really overlay the default UnifiedVaccineTypeInfo.
