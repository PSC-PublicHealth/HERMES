<h1>Handling of Initial OVW Estimates 20110920</h1>

<p>
Shipping order sizes obviously depend on open vial waste.  HERMES
calculates overall OVW levels as an output, and since SVN r311 there
has been a mechanism in model.UpdateWastageEstimates to continuously
change the OVW estimates used in calculating shipment sizes based on
the current cumulative output estimate of OVW.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there is a problem with this for the case of 'pull'
shipments, because they calculate and freeze in their trigger level
and fill-up-to level based on a demand calculation done at time 0.0.
This means they use the initial OVW estimate, not any later updated
version.  This caused a problem with simulations with a lot of 'pull'
shipments, which means problems for Niger.  An obvious notion would be
to update the threshold levels at the end of the burn-in period, but
since the time during burn-in doesn't have 'normal' shipping patterns
the results would be improved but still not satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
What is implemented now (as of roughly SVN r463) is that the user can
specify an input table of OVW values; pull thresholds are set using
these values or the OVW value 0.5 if no input is given.  (The behavior
between r311 and r463 effectively used values of 0.5 or 0.0 depending
on the specific case).  To specify input values, construct a .csv file
like:
<pre>
"Name","OVW"
"T_Tuberculosis",0.246535282898919
"T_DTP",0.148457755923111
"T_Oral Polio",0.125549122323316
"T_Japanese Encephalitis",0.0430728768982778
"T_HepB",0.0343791722296395
"T_DTP-HepB",0.0963103122043519
"T_MMR-unidose",0
</pre>
or the equivalent for the vaccine names in use.  It's probably best to
do a simulation run and use the output OVW values for these inputs.
If the name for the file is 'test_ovw.csv', add a line like:
<pre>
initialovw='test_ovw.csv'
</pre>
to the input.kvp file for the run.  To reproduce the results for the
mechanism that was in place between r311 and r463, make a file filled
with the value 0.5 or the value 0.0 .
