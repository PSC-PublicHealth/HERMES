<h1>Deliverables, Shippables, and How Their Relationships Are Managed</h1>

This is written 20121221, near the time when the HERMES_jsw_deliverables branch
is merged back into the trunk.
<p>

The Deliverable class is a mix-in to the Shippable class, not a derived class.
It carries the prepForDelivery method and an associated exception.  Before being
used, an instance of a Deliverable class is expected to have prepForDelivery called;
it will raise the new PrepFailure exception if preparation fails.
</p>
<p>
Conceptually, a Deliverable is something the patient gets, and it may require other 
Shippables before the patient can get it.  French fries are a Deliverable; fry oil
is a Shippable consumed in the process of perparing the french fries for delivery.  
The obvious use here is the vaccines are Deliverables and their associated diluents
are just Shippables without the Deliverable mix-in.  
</p>
<p>
If a Shippable is defined as depending on something else, that something else is
inherently forced to be a Shippable rather than a Deliverable.  Once all dependencies
have been set, those things which nothing else depends on are by definition Deliverables.
Thus, Fridges are Deliverables because they are Shippables which are not consumed to
prepare any other Shippable for delivery.
</p>
<p>
A treatment session of a UseVials process will use a DemandModel to select a
set of vaccines to be delivered.  The shippables necessary to prepare those
vaccines for delivery are calculated (using ShippableTypeManager.getPrepSupplies(sC)),
and the sum of the original vaccines and the associated consumables is requested
from the Store.  For full treatment to occur, more than one type of supply must be
available- for example, both vaccine and diluent.  This tends to lower the supply ratio
because there is an additional avenue by which the supply can fail.
</p>
<p>
Note that <b>DemandModels return collections of Deliverables</b>, and the need for the required 
consumable Shippables is implied.  Thus a DemandModel (and the associated demand file)
would list a vaccine, but not its associated diluent.  HERMES fills in the need for
the diluent.  The requirement is specified by including a 'Requires' column in the definition
file for the Shippable type, and using standard notation (like '2*THIS_THING+THAT_THING) to
give type names and counts for required Shippables.  Any Shippables which are not Deliverable
and which are included in a demand file will get transported to the clinic but will not be used!
</p>
<p>The addition of required Shippables to the demand must take place in the model's methods 
(getFactoryProductionFunction, getScheduledShipmentSize, getClinicShipQuantity,
getClinicShipThreshold, getWarehouseShipQuantity, and getWarehouseShipThreshold), wherever those
routines call the DemandModel.  It has to occur here so that on-hand consumables can be correctly
subtracted from the order.  The rule is that the process calling the DemandModel should call 
getPrepSupplies as soon as possible thereafter.  The UseVials processes do that when they make
their DemandModel calls.
</p>
<p>
AShippableCollection.addPrepSupplies() is currently applied to vial counts.  It could be
applied to dose counts instead, as long as the number of doses per vial of (say) diluent is
the same as the number of doses per vial of the associated vaccine, and as long as prep supplies
don't overlap.  If two vaccines use the same diluent, however, there will be a problem: the 
number of vials of diluent could be less than that needed to reconstitute the vials of vaccine
of both types.  If that happens, we must consistently apply addPrepSupplies to collections of 
vials.
