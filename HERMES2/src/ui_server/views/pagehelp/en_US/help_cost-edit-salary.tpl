<h3>The <em>Salary Costs</em> Table</h3>
This table allows you to set or adjust costing information associated with staff salaries.  <em>Note that HERMES currently 
only uses information about staff salaries to calculate costs.</em>  The presence or absence of staff does not effect the 
delivery of vaccines in the simulation in any way.  Trucks and warehouses will continue to operate normally even if no
drivers or staff are present.  
<ul>
<li>If the model you want does not appear in the <b>Showing Costs for</b> selector, it may be because results have already been
calculated for the model and changing the model would invalidate those results.  Only models that can be safely changed show
in the selector.  You may need to make a fresh copy of your model, or go to the <em>Results</em> screen and delete the model's
results.

<li>The <b>Base Salary</b> represents the per-year salary of the staff member, in the given <b>Currency</b> and at the
given <b>Base Salary Year</b>.

<li>Often a vaccination program will pay only part of the salary for a given worker.  The <b>Fraction EPI</b> column can
be used to represent this.  For example, if the vaccination program is resonsible for only half the staff member's salary,
set Fraction EPI to 0.5.
