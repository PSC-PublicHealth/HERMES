<h3>The <em>Vehicle Costs</em> Table</h3>
This table allows you to set or adjust costing information associated with transport vehicles.
<ul>
<li>For 'Fixed Fare' costs, the cost of a single fare is given in the 'Fuel Consumption' field.  The currency and year
are given in the Currency and Base Cost Year columns.  Typically the Base Cost will be zero in this case, since the transit 
vehicle is presumably not owned by the vaccination system.
