<p>This step assigns transport vehicles to routes and locations by level. 
Specifying the type of vehicle typically used between a pair of levels will assign that vehicle type to all routes between those levels.
You can later modify this selection for specific routes using the <b>Advanced Model Editor</b>.

<br>
<p>
In each row, use the dropdown menu to select the type of vehicle typically used for transporting vaccines between the two levels. 
Then specify how many vehicles exist at each location where such a route would originate. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
For example, a system may have 3 Region-level locations that deliver vaccines to 40 District locations, and a typical Region location has 2 cold trucks available for these shipments. 
In the row "For Routes between the Region and District levels" a user would select the appropriate type of cold truck from the list and enter 2 for the number of vehicles. 
This would assign 2 cold trucks to each Region location (for a total of 6 cold trucks at the Region level), and these would be used for delivering shipments to the District level.
If District level was instead assigned to pick up vaccines from the Region level, then the vehicles selected here would instead reside at the District locations, where each trip would begin.
