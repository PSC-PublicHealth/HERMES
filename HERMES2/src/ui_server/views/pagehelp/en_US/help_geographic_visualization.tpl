<p>Circles on the map represent locations in the supply chain.
Initially, the size and color of the circles correspond to the level of the supply chain, with larger circles representing locations at higher levels.

<ul>
<li>Select <b>Population</b> to display the relative size of population immunized at each location.
Circles become larger and more red to represent larger populations.
<li>Select <b>Utilization</b> to show the maximum storage capacity utilized at each location during the simulation.
The size of each circle corresponds to the level of the supply chain, and the color becomes more red as maximum storage utilization approaches 100%.
<li>Select <b>Vaccines</b> to color immunizing locations by overall vaccine availability.
Each circle becomes more blue as vaccine availability approaches 100%.
<li>Select <b>Color by Route</b> to display routes as lines connecting locations, with a different color assigned to each route.
<li>Select <b>Color by Utilization</b> to display routes with the color of each line corresponding to the maximum transport utilization for that route during the simulation.
The color becomes more red as maximum transport utilization approaches 100%.
