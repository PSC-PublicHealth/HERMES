<p>This step assigns equipment and people by level. 
Specify the types and quantities of equipment, population, and staff for a typical location at each level, and HERMES will add those components to every location at that level. 
You can later modify these for specific locations using the <b>Advanced Model Editor</b>.

<p>
Storage:
</p><br> 
<p>
After selecting a level, go to the Storage tab. To add a device, click on the "+" at the bottom of the table. 
In the first column, select a device from the list of devices you created in the previous step. 
In the Count column, enter the number of this type of device that would appear at one typical location at this level in the supply chain. 
Add additional devices using the "+" as needed. Remove a device by clicking on its row to select it and then clicking the trash can icon in the bottom-left of the table. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Transport:
</p><br> 
<p>
After selecting a level, go to the Transport tab. See above under "Storage" for instructions on how to add devices, edit quantities, and remove devices. 
Ensure that the necessary transport type is available at any location where a route begins. 
For example, if a location uses a motorbike to pick up vaccines from a higher level, at least one motorbike should be assigned to the location. 
Similarly, if a location uses public transportation (such as a bus) or has staffmembers walk to pick up vaccines, a "device" representing this transportation should be assigned to the location. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Population:
</p><br> 
<p>
After selecting a level, go to the Population tab. Add population types, edit the population size, and remove populations as described above for devices under "Storage." 
Only add populations for levels that administer vaccinations. A level that solely stores and distributes vaccines should not include any populations here. 
The Count for a given population type at a given level should reflect the number of people in that population type who would be included in one typical immunizing location's catchment population at that level. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Staff:
</p><br> 
<p>
After selecting a level, go to the Staff tab. Add staff types, edit the number of staff, and remove staff types as described above for devices under "Storage." 
Staff will only affect cost outcomes. Thus, the same model run with and without staff will produce results that only differ in labor/personnel costs.
