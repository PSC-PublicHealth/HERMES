<p>Specify the average travel time between levels in the supply chain.

<p>
To calculate average travel times, users may need to make assumptions. 
For example, if travel times between locations are unknown but average distances between levels are, 
users may assume a reasonable speed to determine the average travel times between levels.
</p>
<br>
<p>HERMES assigns the same average travel time and distance to all routes between adjacent levels.
After the basic model structure is created, these settings can me modified for individual routes in the next step using the <b>Make Adjustments</b> table or at a later time via the 
<b>Advanced Model Editor</b>.</p>
