<p>Specify the average travel time between levels in the (model name) supply chain.

<br>
<p>
To calculate average travel times, users may need to make assumptions. 
For example, if travel times between locations are unknown but average distances between levels are, 
users may assume a reasonable speed to determine the average travel times between levels.
</p>
<br>
<p>HERMES Create-a-model assigns the same average travel time to all routes between adjacent levels.
All of these settings can me modified after the basic model structure is created via the 
<b>HERMES Advanced Model Editor</b>.</p>
