<h3>Setting Building Costs</h3>
Cost accounting for immunization programs may include costs for buildings, especially at the upper levels of the model.  
This table allows you to set costs for buildings.  Any buildings for which you do not set costs are assumed to be 'free'.
Building costs can also be set via the main <em>Models/Modify</em> page.
<ul>
<li>If the model you want does not appear in the <b>Showing Costs for</b> selector, it may be because results have already been
calculated for the model and changing the model would invalidate those results.  Only models that can be safely changed show
in the selector.  You may need to make a fresh copy of your model, or go to the <em>Results</em> screen and delete the model's
results.
<li>For convenience, this table groups locations by level in the shipping model.  To unfold a level, click on the '+' icon
to the left of the level name.  Each row of the table shows one location, listed by name and location ID code.
<li>For each location, the building <b>Cost Per Year</b> is given in that column, in the given <b>Currency</b> and 
<b>Cost Base Year</b>.
