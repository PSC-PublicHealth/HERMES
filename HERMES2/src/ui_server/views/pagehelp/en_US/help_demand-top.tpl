<p>In HERMES, demand is determined by the populations served by each location and the vaccine schedule for each population type. 
Population types are each a single group of people who receive the same vaccine(s) throughout the simulation; often, 
they are based on ages as defined by a particular region's vaccine regimen. For example, according to one regimen the rotavirus vaccine may be administered to children aged 2 months 
- in this case, a user would create a population type called "Age 2" and choose rotavirus vaccine to be administered to this group.</p> 
<br><br>
<p>To set the demand, select the components (vaccines and population types) you'd like to include in the dose schedule from the 
"Include in the dose table?" box. Then, in the box labelled "How many doses of each vaccine?", enter the number of doses per population type for each vaccine.</p>
