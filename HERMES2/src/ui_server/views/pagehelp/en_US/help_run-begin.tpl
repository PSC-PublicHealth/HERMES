<p>This is the first step in running a HERMES model. 
Here you will select a model to run and enter a name for the set of results. 
Once you have finished this short set of pages, the execution of your model will begin.
You can continue to modify or other models while this model is running.
If you leave this sequence of screens too early, your model will not begin running but you will be able to return to the sequence where you left off by selecting Run again. 
Specifying the type of vehicle typically used between a pair of levels will assign that vehicle type to all routes between those levels.
You can later modify this selection for specific routes using the <b>Advanced Model Editor</b>.
First select a pair of levels, then use the Truck Type dropdown menu to select the appropriate vehicle type.
