<h3>The <em>Vaccine Costs</em> Table</h3>
This table allows you to set or adjust costing information associated with vaccines.  The table is grouped by vaccine type
for easier access.  To see individual vaccines, click the '+' icon to the left of the vaccine category name.
<p>
Vaccine costs are quite simple.  The <b>Cost Per Vial</b> is the cost of a full vial of vaccine, specified in the given
<b>Currency</b> and purchased in the given <b>Base Cost Year</b>.
<p>
If the model you want does not appear in the <b>Showing Costs for</b> selector, it may be because results have already been
calculated for the model and changing the model would invalidate those results.  Only models that can be safely changed show
in the selector.  You may need to make a fresh copy of your model, or go to the <em>Results</em> screen and delete the model's
results.
