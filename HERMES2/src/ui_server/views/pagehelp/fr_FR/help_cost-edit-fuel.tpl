<li>{{_("If the model you want does not appear in the Showing Costs for selector, it may be because results have already been calculated for the model and changing the model would invalidate those results.  Only models that can be safely changed show in the selector.  You may need to make a fresh copy of your model, or go to the Results screen and delete the model's results.")}}

<li>{{_("Each row shows the price for a given fuel, and the currency in which that price is expressed.  The prices are assumed to be valid for the model's base year.")}}

<li>{{_("The last row lets you set the number of years used for solar panel amortization.  Solar panels only appear in the desription of a model in the form of storage devices with solar power.  Every such device is assumed to be purchased with accompanying solar panels, purchased at a price per installed kilowatt given in the Solar Power field.  Note that a proper estimate of solar panel costs will require a knowledge of the average available solar energy per square meter for the country which is being modeled.")}}
