{{_("Specify the shipping policy at each level in the supply chain. Shipping policies within HERMES determine how healthcare products are distributed from higher levels to lower levels and depend on three parameters: the quantity of products shipped per trip, where the shipment originates, and how often the shipment occurs.")}}
</p>
<br>
<p>
{{_("The quantity of products can be fixed or variable; in fixed product shipments, a fixed number of products is always shipped, as long as that number of products is available at the originating location (if there are not enough products, all available are shipped). In variable product shipments, the quantity of products is determined by the anticipated demand at the receiving location. For example, a health clinic that expects to need 15 BCG vaccine vials within the shipping interval would receive 15 BCG vials in a variable product shipment.")}}
</p>
<br>
<p>{{_("Shipments can originate at the supplier or at the receiver. Shipments picked up by the receiver originate from the receiving location; shipments dropped off by the supplier originate from the supplying location. Resources such as vehicles and labor are used by the originating location. For example, a shipment being dropped off by a national store at a regional store would use a driver and vehicle that originated at the national store.")}}
</p>
<br>
<p>
{{_("Frequency of shipments can be fixed or as-needed. Fixed shipments happen at regular time intervals, while as-needed shipments happen when the receiving location's stock falls below a certain threshold. Please specify the frequency at which fixed-schedule shipments occur. For as-needed shipments, specify the maximum frequency (for example, if Health Posts are assigned as-needed shipments up to 1 time per month, then the Health Posts will receive shipments when vaccines are needed but no more than once per month).")}}

{{_("HERMES assigns the same shipping policies to all routes between adjacent levels. All of these settings can me modified after the basic model structure is created via the Make Adjustments page or in even further detail via the HERMES Advanced Model Editor.")}}
