{{_("If the model you want does not appear in the Showing Costs for selector, it may be because results have already been calculated for the model and changing the model would invalidate those results.  Only models that can be safely changed show in the selector.  You may need to make a fresh copy of your model, or go to the Results screen and delete the model's results.")}}
