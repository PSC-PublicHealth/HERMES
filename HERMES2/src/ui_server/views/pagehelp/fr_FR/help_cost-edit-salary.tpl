<h3>{{_("The Salary Costs Table</h3>
		{{_("This table allows you to set or adjust costing information associated with staff salaries.  Note that HERMES currently only uses information about staff salaries to calculate costs.  The presence or absence of staff does not effect the delivery of vaccines in the simulation in any way.  Trucks and warehouses will continue to operate normally even if no drivers or staff are present.")}}

<li>{{_("If the model you want does not appear in the Showing Costs for selector, it may be because results have already been calculated for the model and changing the model would invalidate those results.  Only models that can be safely changed show in the selector.  You may need to make a fresh copy of your model, or go to the Results screen and delete the model's results.")}} 

<li>{{_("The Base Salary represents the per-year salary of the staff member, in the given Currency and at the given Base Salary Year.")}} 

<li>{{_("Often a vaccination program will pay only part of the salary for a given worker.  The Fraction EPI column can be used to represent this.  For example, if the vaccination program is resonsible for only half the staff member's salary, set Fraction EPI to 0.5.")}}
