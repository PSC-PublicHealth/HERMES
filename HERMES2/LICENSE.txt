4. Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between User and JHU regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous oral or written communications, proposals, agreements and representations, if any, relating to the subject matter hereof. JHU reserves the right to modify this Agreement and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on the access, viewing and use of the Program at any time and in its sole discretion. Such modifications and additional terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. The continued use of the Program by or on behalf of User will be deemed acceptance thereof. The failure of any party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement, will not act as a bar to subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. The provisions of this Agreement will be considered severable, so that the invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions; provided that no such severability will be effective if it materially changes the agreement contained herein. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning and interpretation of this Agreement. All terms and conditions that by their nature should survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 2, 3, and 4 hereof, will survive. If applicable, User hereby agrees that User will not use or otherwise export the Program in violation or prohibition of United States and any other applicable laws, statutes and regulations.

User and University hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (i) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland for any proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement and each such party agrees not to commence any such proceeding except in such courts, and (ii) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such proceeding in the courts of the State of Maryland.  EACH OF University AND USER, KNOWINGLY, FOR ITSELF, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM ARISING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTER RELATED IN ANY WAY THERETO.
